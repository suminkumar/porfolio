        <p>There are very few better sights in world cricket than witnessing a free-flowing Yuvraj Singh at his best.
            Undoubtedly, he is right up there among the greatest match-winners in white-ball cricket. Those glorious
            cover drives, slap cuts through backward point and an effortless wristy drop kick over mid-wicket, all oozed
            class. His full repertoire was on display during his international debut that came in the 50-overs format
            against Australia in the 2000 Champions Trophy. It wasn't everyday that a batsman put the formidable Aussie
            attack to sword during that time and certainly not a rookie. Yuvraj had arrived with a bang and what
            instantly stood out apart from his batting, was the electric fielding skills. India's fielding was on an
            average level in that era and hence someone like Yuvraj came as a whiff of fresh air.
